YAOS - Yet Another Operating System
===================================

You may ask - what's the use of yet another operating system :-) ?  Just try to browse the net and you will find numerous kernels, free OS-es and similar projects.  Well, if you look more closely, the vast majority of the stuff `out there' exists only as a 'wish list', an unimplemented specifications of something that is supposed to be the `perfect' project.

I know there are people out there who just love to write stuff (me being one of them).  Now I talk to those people who just can't wait to lay their hands on something and create and improve it.  I dont say there's no need to work on Linux, Minix, FreeBSD, FreeDOS or some other `cool' project, but the fact to be able to influence the design from the very beginning is important.  I think every now and then we need a new project to work on to `sharpen' our senses, to discover new approaches and styles, and to apply what we have learned so far.

Yaos is (also) created from the scratch.  It was designed to help learning Intel 80X86 operation by having a full-blown debugger with the symbols support.
